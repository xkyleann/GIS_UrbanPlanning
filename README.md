## Project Description 
Project aims to leverage **_GIS_**, **_machine learning_**, and **_historical data_** analysis to automate the **_identification_** of cities in given snapshots and assess their environmental changes over time. The system will use machine learning models to **_recognize cities_**, retrieve historical data, and perform **_spatial analysis_** to compare current and past land use, population, and forestation levels. The project will calculate the environmental impact of changes, **_generate error reports_**, and **_suggest zoning plans_** for tree planting to **_improve forestation_**. The interactive visualization component allows users to explore city data, view historical trends, and understand the implications of urban development on the environment. This project seeks to provide valuable insights for sustainable **_urban planning_** and **_environmentalÂ conservation_**.
